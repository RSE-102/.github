# Course material for RSE 102

## What is this?

This is course material for a one-week graduate school block course, which is regularly given at the University of Stuttgart. The block course emerged from material of the two master lectures [Simulation Software Engineering](https://simulation-software-engineering.github.io) and [Sustainable Development of Simulation Software](https://gitlab.com/sustainable-simulation-software/course-material) in an effort to teach better research software engineering skills to PhD students.

**Why 102?** We do not start from scratch, but assume a certain pre-knowledge from participants -- knowledge typically taught in Software Carpentry Workshops: Unix shell, Git basics, and Python. We want to build on these fundamentals and study methods and tools used to ensure good (research) software engineering:

- Git workflows
- Containerization
- Testing and continuous integration
- Building and packaging
- Software design principles

Skills in these areas are crucial for developing or contributing to quality-assured software in collaborative environments and are very useful in today’s research landscape. For an overview over the topics, see the [lecture material](https://github.com/RSE-102/Lecture-Material).

## Credits

- The Simulation Software Engineering lecture was originally developed by [Ishaan Desai](https://github.com/IshaanDesai), [Alexander Jaust](https://github.com/ajaust), and [Benjamin Uekermann](https://github.com/uekerman). [Many students](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/Lecture-Material/graphs/contributors) helped improving the content.
- The Sustainable Development of Simulation Software was originally developed by [Dennis Gläser](https://github.com/dglaeser) and [Bernd Flemisch](https://github.com/berndflemisch).

In several parts of the material, we use content from

> Irving, Hertweck, Johnston, Ostblom, Wickham, and Wilson: [Research Software Engineering with Python](https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse), 2021,

a book, which we also recommend to recap Git/Bash/Python basics.
